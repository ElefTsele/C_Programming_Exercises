# C Programming Exercises

Practical C programming exercises, organized in a clean, modular structure with optional testing and professional coding practices.

Based on the excellent "C Programming Examples" playlist by [Portfolio Courses](https://www.youtube.com/@PortfolioCourses), this repository expands each example with:

- Modular C code (`.h` / `.c`)
- Robust error handling and status enums
- Common macros (array size, clamp, swap, etc.)
- Unit testing setup (planned: Unity framework)
- Future CI/CD integration
